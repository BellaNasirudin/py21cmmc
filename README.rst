A set of python bindings for 21cmFAST allowing native Python plugins for 21cmMC.

Note: this package has just started. Don't try to use it yet.

* Free software: MIT license

Installation
============

First, you'll need to have the required C libraries: ``gsl``, ``fftw`` (make sure you install the floating-point version!)
``openmp`` and ``gslcblas``.

Then just do::

    pip install py21cmmc

Or to get the bleeding edge::

    pip install git+git://github.com/steven-murray/py21cmmc.git

Quick Usage
===========

Either use the functions from ``py21cmmc._utils``, or use the provided CLI::

    $ py21cmmc --help

At this point, the basic workflow is to first run ``./init`` and ``./perturb_field`` using a separate working ``21cmFAST``
installation. Do all the redshifts that are required (with ``./perturb_field``). Then you need to create a config file -- an
example is given in this repo as ``example_config.yml``. Make sure all the settings in that file are as you want them
(especially the directories containing the boxes you just made). Then use the CLI as written above, with the config
file as an argument. If the ``output`` option is specified, the full deltaT box will be written to that file (in fact, it
will be several deltaT boxes, one for each redshift).

Documentation
=============

https://py21cmmc.readthedocs.io/

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:
